Notes:

US patents
application number - assigned when application filed at USPTO (format: YY/######)
publication number - assigned when application is published (format: YYYY/#######)
patent number - assigned if the application is granted  (format ########)


Process:
0. Determine patent scrape method
  - Python API / functions?
  - Search for all patents or by list of keywords?
  - Storing data? (text files, csv for patent numbers ...)
1. Scrape patent text (abstracts, patent number, body of text (2nd iteration))
2. Prepare scraped data 
  - tokenize data (i.e. list of strings, remove spaces, remove newlines, lowercase,..)
  - Parts of Speech (POS) tagging - filtering unnecessary words
  - Word stemming - reducing words to base or root form
  - What to do with unkonwn words / characters?
3. Prepare model
  - Transfer learning with pretrained model or from scratch?
  - Additional features / final layers for transfer learning model?
  - How to make it so that an output is a paragraph?
     - start with single keyword and let the model sequentially predict next word?
4. Split data to Train/Test 
  - Is this done in NLP?
5. Train model
6. Make predictions
